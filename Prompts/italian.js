                  Instructions for Vocabulary Extraction and Localization
                    - Vocabulary Extraction:
                    Extract 7 relevant words that represent visible objects, actions, or themes in the image. Add 2 words for mood or atmosphere if possible.
                    - Translations:
                    Provide the English translation of each word.
                    - Word Variations:
                    For verbs, provide common conjugations. For adjectives and nouns, provide plural or feminine/masculine forms if applicable.
                    - Word Properties:
                    State each word's type (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
                    Include the pronunciation in simplified phonetic notation.
                    - Locations:
                    Provide each word's location in the format "[x%, y%]" based on the image dimensions.
                    Each word should occupy a 10% width and 5% height area to prevent overlaps where possible.
                    - Example Sentences:
                    Use each word in a simple sentence and translate the sentence to English.
